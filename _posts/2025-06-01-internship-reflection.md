In May 2024, I joined [Every Texan](https://everytexan.org) as a Research & Data Intern‚Äîand now, a little over a year later, I can confidently say it‚Äôs been one of the most fulfilling and formative parts of my undergraduate journey.

## üß† What I Worked On

My work spanned data storytelling, policy research, and pipeline building. Some highlights included:

- **SNAP Recipient Profile (2025):** A deep dive into who receives food assistance in Texas, using American Community Survey data to dismantle myths and showcase the realities of low-income families.
- **Texas Poverty Data Brief (2025):** Led analysis and visualization for a statewide report on poverty trends, with a focus on equity gaps by region, language, and education.
- **Bilingual Texans Report (2024):** Modeled income and health disparities among bilingual households, using logistic regression and caret modeling in R to identify drivers of inequity.
- **KIDS COUNT 2024 Dashboard (2024):** Helped build a statewide child well-being tool by cleaning and joining data from dozens of sources, including census data, state agency data, and health surveys.

Each project helped me sharpen my technical skills **and** think critically about how data reflects‚Äîand can transform‚Äîreal lives.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Skills I Gained

- **ArcGIS & Visualization Tools:** From choropleth maps to dashboards, I learned how to make insights not only accurate, but accessible and intuitive.
- **Cloud & Big Data:** I built and documented pipelines for messy, large-scale datasets, learning how to clean, store, and manage data across time.
- **Literature Reviews & Policy Context:** A major part of my role involved understanding the *why* behind the numbers‚Äîcontextualizing trends in academic and policy literature.
- **Cross-Team Collaboration:** I worked closely with policy analysts, communications staff, and leadership, learning to bridge technical work with strategic goals.
- **Project Management Through a School Year:** Juggling academic demands with long-term project goals taught me how to stay organized, self-directed, and responsive.

## üí° Why It Mattered

This internship didn‚Äôt just strengthen my resume‚Äîit clarified my *why*. It showed me that **data science isn‚Äôt just about numbers**‚Äîit‚Äôs about narratives, action, and empathy. Whether visualizing language isolation or evaluating poverty trends, I saw firsthand how rigorous analysis can support the people doing the hard work of advocacy, policy, and change.

More than anything, I learned how to build with care, collaborate with purpose, and use data to **amplify impact**.
