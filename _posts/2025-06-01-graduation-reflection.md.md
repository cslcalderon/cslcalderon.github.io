I just graduated from UT Austin with a B.S. in Computational Biology, a certificate in Programming and Computation, and a minor in Data Science. As I step into this next chapter, I’ve been reflecting on what I’ve learned—not just from textbooks or lectures, but from the process of building, analyzing, and adapting.

### 📊 Projects That Shaped Me

Over the past few years, I’ve worked on projects that bridged my interests in policy, equity, and data. Some of the most impactful included:

---
### 🪴 Plant Care Assistant Web App (Fall 2023)

This was a solo Python project where I built a **personalized plant care app** using **Streamlit**, the **Perennial API**, and **Pandas**. Features included:
- Real-time data lookup for 5,000+ plant species
- Automated task tracking (watering, sunlight, care tips)
- UI designed for beginner-friendly plant support

It taught me how to connect APIs, manage dynamic UIs, and deliver tailored recommendations—an experience close to real product design.


### 📺 Dr. Who Viewership Analysis (Fall 2023)

This collaborative project focused on time-series data and regressions to understand factors affecting Dr. Who’s viewership across seasons. We:
- Cleaned and modeled data in R
- Investigated the effects of showrunners, companions, air dates, and review ratings
- Used AIC to compare competing models and interactions
- Visualized viewership and critic score trends with custom ggplot2 visuals

It was a fun and challenging project that taught me how to evaluate models in a social/cultural context and communicate statistical uncertainty clearly.

### 🎲 World Cube Association Project (Spring 2024)

As a fun capstone, I analyzed data from the World Cube Association to understand performance trends in Rubik’s Cube competitions. I:
- Cleaned and joined multiple tables of WCA competition data
- Explored historical patterns in best times and participation by event and country
- Visualized the evolution of speedcubing over time with animated plots
- Highlighted gender differences and emerging national leaders in the cubing world

It was a playful but technically rich project that let me practice storytelling with clean visuals, and connect niche interests with broader statistical insights.

### 🏫 Google School Enrollment Dashboard (Spring 2025)

Another major milestone was designing an education data pipeline using **Google BigQuery** and **Looker Studio**. I:
- Processed 40+ CSVs of K–12 enrollment data across states
- Wrote SQL queries to examine trends by race, gender, grade, and socioeconomic status
- Built dashboards to show Section 504 participation and free/reduced lunch rates
- Applied cleaning and type-casting workflows to make messy data usable

It was my first end-to-end data engineering and visualization project on a cloud platform — and one that directly supported educational equity analysis.

### 🐦 FeederWatch Bird Project (Spring 2025)

This was one of the most curious and creative projects I’ve worked on. Using 2021 FeederWatch data, I built models to explore how habitat type shapes species richness and abundance. I:
- Encoded 30+ habitat variables
- Ran PCA to identify environmental gradients
- Built decision trees and multinomial logistic models to predict yard type and species
- Tuned an XGBoost model to impute missing bird counts with solid accuracy

This project taught me how to apply machine learning models to ecological data, and how to translate raw observations into meaningful biological insights.

### 📚 Courses That Mattered

There were classes that especially challenged and inspired me:

- **Elements of Data Science**
- **Elements of Databases**
- **Introduction to Statistical Machine Learning**
- **Regression Analysis**
- **Probability & Statistics**
- **Software Engineering and Systems Design**

These courses helped build my toolkit: from SQL joins to model cross-validation, from writing unit tests to deploying structured codebases.

### 💡 Lessons Beyond Code

What I’ve learned isn’t just technical. These projects reminded me that data can be playful, purposeful, and deeply human. From building a plant care app to analyzing bird habitats or visualizing educational access, I’ve seen how data connects us to the world—and to each other. I want to keep exploring problems that matter, designing solutions that feel thoughtful, and making insights that are clear, compassionate, and impactful.

Thanks for reading, and stay tuned — there’s a lot more I’m excited to share.
