Hi there! I’m Sofia Calderon — born in Texas, raised all over it.

I’m from **Dallas**, but I’ve lived in **El Paso**, **Odessa**,**Mexico** and now with four incredible years spent studying in **Austin**.

### 🎓 Education

I graduated from The University of Texas at Austin, Class of 2025, with a Bachelor of Science in Computational Biology, a Data Science minor, and a certificate in Computer Science.

What is *Computational Biology*? It's a degree that lives at the intersection of natural sciences, statistics, and computer science. It means I’ve spent years asking: *What can data teach us about the world around us—from ecosystems and equity to code and computation?*

Through a few clever loopholes (and a lot of passion), I made sure to load up on courses in machine learning, databases, software engineering, and statistical modeling. I was determined to build a foundation that’s both technical and thoughtful.

### 📈 What I Do

I love working with data that means something. Whether it’s building machine learning models, crafting cloud-based pipelines, or designing interactive dashboards, I’m most excited when data becomes actionable — when it’s used to tell stories, drive decisions, or make systems more just.

Some of my core strengths:
- Applied statistics & regression modeling  
- End-to-end project pipelines (from messy raw data to clean insight)  
- Data visualization and communication  
- Equity-focused research and reporting

### 💡 Why It Matters

To me, data is more than just numbers — it’s a lens. It’s a way to understand problems deeply, to bridge perspectives, and to spark meaningful action. Whether I’m coding up a model or cleaning an enourmous and extremely messy dataset, I approach every project with care and curiosity.
